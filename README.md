This action could be used to build and test a [ROS 2](https://www.ros.org/) workspace from source.

## Usage

For more information, see [action.yml](./action.yml) and the [GitHub Actions guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions).

### Default Usage

```yaml
name: Build and Test Workspace
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build-and-test-workspace:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout this repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
        with:
          path: repository
      - name: Build and test workspace
        uses: ichiro-its/ros2-build-and-test-action@main
```

> This will be defaulted to use [ROS 2 Iron Irwini](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Releases/Release-Iron-Irwini.html).

> It's recommended to not checkout the repository in the root directory.
> Else, test could be failed because the package's files are mixed with the build result.

### Use Different ROS 2 Distribution

```yaml
- name: Build and test workspace
  uses: ichiro-its/ros2-build-and-test-action@main
  with:
    ros2-distro: rolling
```
